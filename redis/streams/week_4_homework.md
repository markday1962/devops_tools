## Week 4 Homework

Question: You run XPENDING and discover that one of your consumers, consumer A, has one pending message. 
In which of the following circumstances might you use XCLAIM to claim that message for another consumer?

Answer: If the message has been delivered and has been pending for 100,000 ms, then this is a possible indication of a failed or stuck consumer. 
If the consumer itself has been idle for 100,000 ms, this is further evidence that there may be a problem with the consumer. 
The message might be worth claiming for another consumer. Consumer A has an idle time of 1ms: Consumers with a low idle time are likely productively working.
The delivery counter shows a value of 1 and a time-since-delivery of 10 ms: This message was recently delivered and hasn't be idle long enough to warrant reclaiming for another consumer.
In the last case, it's possible that the message was just recently assigned to consumer A. The many deliveries may have been to another, lost consumer.

Question: Suppose you run `XCLAIM numbers primes B 10000 123-0` Under what conditions will the message 123-0 be claimed for consumer B?

Answer: To claim a message, the message must exist in some consumer's PEL. In addition, its time-since-delivery must be greater than the min-idle-time specified 
as an argument to XCLAIM. In this case, at least 10,000 ms must have passed since the message was last read/delivered.
A consumer need not exist to have messages claimed for it; the consumer will be created on demand.

Question: Suppose you have a stream containing minute-by-minute temperature measurements for the last year. That's 60 x 24 x 365 = 525,600 messages. You then run the following command:
`XRANGE measurements - +` What's the potential problem with running this?

Answer: XRANGE is O(n) on the number of messages returned. It's usually not a good idea to run XRANGE without also specifying a value for COUNT. 
Returning large numbers of values from XRANGE can block the server for a long time, rendering the server temporarily unavailable.

Question: What does the Redis MEMORY USAGE command do?

Answer: The MEMORY USAGE command shows the number of bytes allocated to the specified data structure. 
You can use this command to estimate the eventual size of a Redis stream, or of any other Redis data structure.

Question: ou need to store a continuously streaming dataset in Redis. Each message needs to be preserved for one month after creation, 
but no longer than that. Which technique or command can you use to manage the memory needed to store the dataset?

Answer: Currently, to get time-based retention, you need use date-based stream partitioning combined with Redis's built-in key expiration.

Question: You have a stream containing audio recordings and a cluster of microservices that can classify these audio recordings based on their background noise.
You want to share out this work, processing 100 messages at a time, and you don't know in advance how long it will take to process each message.
The audio recordings in the messages are completely independent from each other, so can be processed in any order. Which is the best stream consumption strategy for this use case?
